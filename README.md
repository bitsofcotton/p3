# p3
Generic predictor based on some of the smooth surfaces.

# Description
If we can take multiplication invariant on f, S f(x) dx == S det(J((1,g\_0,...)/(1,x\_0,...))) dx\_0 ...

So we take first hypothesis as g\_0, ... is simple enough in f's addition, multiplication meaning.
(This is (g\_0 x y\) == (h\_0 x ...) simple enough meaning.)

So analogy to this, we take \[\[1, 1, ...\], \[g\_0, ...\], \[\parial g\_0/\partial x, ...\], ..., \[\partial^N g\_0/\partial x^N, ...\]\] for pseudo integration core.

We should list up simple function as g\_k first, then, we fit some of the jacobians next.

# Concept only in eternal
We don't implement this because we don't need them now.
So this is a concept only document.

# Flatten N
If original processor has infected on invariants, we might get better result with this 'one of a approximation with simple enough is the best' algorithm.
But in general, they might come from the software/hardware infection in low layers, so in their case, we cannot vanish them.
